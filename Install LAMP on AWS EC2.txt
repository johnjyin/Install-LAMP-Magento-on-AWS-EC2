#
#   Installing a LAMP Web Server
#
# 

    # We use Amazon Lunix because we believe we can get a better support from Amazon
	# This Tutorial has been always updated by Amazon and very helpful
	# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-LAMP.html
	
	# Here is just a summary of all steps, for details for above Amazon on-line tutorial
	
	# To connect AWS EC2 instance from Windows Using PuTTY
	# Details as following link
	# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-connect-to-instance-linux.html#using-putty
	
	# Update all software packages
	$ sudo yum update -y
	
	# Use the yum groupinstall to intall multiple software packages
	#    include: Apache web server, MySQL, and PHP software packages
	
	# We can list out what package in yum
	$ yum grouplist
	
	# This moment (2014 September) the Apache Web Server is 2.2.7, MySQL is 5.5, PHP is 5.3
	$ sudo yum groupinstall -y "Web Server" "MySQL Database" "PHP Support"
	
	# We can use following command to list all related information
	$ php -i
	# or just php version
	$ php -v
	# or just MySQL version
	$ mysqladmin -u root -p version
	# or just Apache version
	$ httpd -v
	
    # Install the php-mysql package.
	$ sudo yum install -y php-mysql
	
	# Start the Apache web server
	$ sudo service httpd start
	
	# Use the chkconfig command to configure the Apache web server to start at each system boot
	$ sudo chkconfig httpd on
	
	# You can verify that httpd is on by running the following command.
	$ chkconfig --list httpd
	
#
#
#	To set file permissions
#
#

    # The Amazon Linux Apache document root is /var/www/html, which is owned by root as default.
    # The Amazon EC2 Instance default user is ec2-user
	# To allow ec2-user to manipulate files in this directory, 
	# we need to modify the ownership and permissions of the directory.
	
	# Add the www group to your instance.
	$ sudo groupadd www
	
	# Add your user (in this case, ec2-user) to the www group.
	$ sudo usermod -a -G www ec2-user
	
	# Log out 
	$ exit
	
	# Reconnect to your instance, and then run the following command 
	# to verify your membership in the www group.
	$ groups
	
	# Change the group ownership of /var/www and its contents to the www group.
	$ sudo chown -R root:www /var/www
	
	# Change the directory permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories to 
	# add group write permissions and to set the group ID on future subdirectories.
	$ sudo chmod 2775 /var/www
    $ find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} +
	
	# Recursively change the file permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories 
	# to add group write permissions.
	$ find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} +
	
#
#
#	To secure the MySQL server
#
#

    # The default installation of the MySQL server has several features that are 
	# great for testing and development, but they should be disabled or removed 
	# for production servers.
	
	# Start the MySQL server so that you can run mysql_secure_installation. 
	$ sudo service mysqld start
	
	# Run mysql_secure_installation. 
	$ sudo mysql_secure_installation
	
	# When prompted, enter a password for the root account.

        # - Enter the current root password. By default, the root account 
		#   does not have a password set, so press Enter.

        # - Type Y to set a password, and enter a secure password twice. 
		#   For more information about creating a secure password, 
		#   go to http://www.pctools.com/guides/password/. Make sure to store this password in a safe place.

    # Type Y to remove the anonymous user accounts.

    # Type Y to disable remote root login.

    # Type Y to remove the test database.

    # Type Y to reload the privilege tables and save your changes.
	
	# To make MySQL server to start at every boot, enter the following command.
	$ sudo chkconfig mysqld on

#
#
#	Create Database
#
#

	# create yourdatabase
	# login PhpMyAdmin, and create your_database
	
	# login MySql as root
	[root@ip-172-31-29-211 httpd]# mysql -u root -p
	Enter password:

	# create new user
	mysql> create user 'your_database_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password'

	# grant user database priviliege
	mysql> GRANT ALL ON your_database.* TO 'your_database_user'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	mysql> flush privileges;
