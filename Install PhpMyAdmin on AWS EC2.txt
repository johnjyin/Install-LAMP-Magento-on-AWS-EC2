#	install phpMyAdmin
#
# 	

	# There are two ways to install phpmyadmin :
	# 1. Download phpmyadmin package and install that
	# 2. Installing through repositories by enabling epel


#
#
#	install phpMyAdmin (1st Method)
#
#
	
	# Firstly, we configure the phpMyAdmin apache configuration.
	# Open the apache config file
	$ nano /etc/http/conf/httpd.conf
	
	# Search and change the following line to append index.php to the end of it.
	$ DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var
	
	# You can search in nano by using Ctrl + W. After the change it should be
	DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var index.php

	# Restart the Apache Web Server
	$ /etc/init.d/httpd restart
	# or
	$ sudo service httpd restart
	
	# Download the latest copy of PhpMyAdmin and copy into the /var/www/html folder. 
	# Extract the contents and copy the contents to phpMyAdmin
	$ cd /var/www/html
	$ wget http://kaz.dl.sourceforge.net/project/phpmyadmin/phpMyAdmin/4.2.7/phpMyAdmin-4.2.7-all-languages.tar.gz
	
	# Extract the files 
	$ tar -zxvf phpMyAdmin-4.2.7-all-languages.tar.gz
	$ mv phpMyAdmin-4.2.7-all-languages phpMyAdmin
	
	# Access the phpMyAdmin by http://your-site-base-url/phpMyAdmin
	
#
#
#	Install phpMyAdmin (2nd method)
#
#

	# sudo yum --enablerepo=epel install phpmyadmin
	
	# There are many guide can refer to
	# for example, https://gist.github.com/aronwoost/1105007
	# which guide to install phpMyAdmin v2.2

	#
	#
	#	Uninstall phpMyAdmin
	#
	#
		# first find all packges related to php
		$ rpm -qa | grep php
		$ yum remove phpmyadmin


	# The 2nd method would be easier to do, but the phpmyadmin version would decided 
	# by the repository of EPEL. Usually, it would be one older version phpmyadmin.

#
#
#	Enhance the phpMyAdmin security by .htaccess
#
#
	# Create a .htaccess file to the phpMyAdmin folder within the instance 
	# and using htpasswd to secure the site using basic HTTP authentication. 
	$ cd /var/www/html/phpMyAdmin
	# Create a empty .htaccess file
	$ touch .htaccess

	# Edit .htaccess 
	$ nano .htaccess
	# To input following rules into .htaccess
	AuthUserFile /var/www/html/phpMyAdmin/.htpasswd
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName "My Secret Folder"
	Required valid-user
	# Note:
	# AuthType : refers to the type of authentication that wil be use to check the passwrd
	# AuthName : text that will be displayed at the password prompt and you can Put anything
	# AuthUserFile : path for file password / will create next step
	# Require valid-user : tells the .htaccess file that only users in password file to access it.
	

	# Then to create .htpasswd
	# Use the htpasswd command to create .htpasswd file 
	# and place it in a directory of your choice as long as it is not accessible from a browser.
    $ htpasswd -c .htaccess user-name
	# You will then be prompted for a password the user-name
	
	# Last to restart the apache
	$ service httpd restart
